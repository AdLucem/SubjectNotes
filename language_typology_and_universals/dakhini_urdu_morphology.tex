\section{Nouns}

\subsection{Three Classes of Nouns}

\subsubsection{Class 1: Marked Masculine, Suffixed}
\subsubsection{Unmarked Masculine/Feminine, Plural Suffix}
\subsubsection{Unmarked Masculine/Feminine, Zero Suffix}

\subsection{A Fourth Class: Postposition}

\subsection{Variations}

\subsubsection{Weakening of Gender Distinction}
\subsubsection{Assimilation into Class 3}
\subsubsection{Interference from Standard Urdu}

\section{Adjectives}

\subsection{Two Classes}

\subsubsection{Marked}

\subsubsection{Unmarked}

\section{Personal Pronouns}

In free variation; however no single speaker's idiolect includes all the forms listed.

\subsection{First Person}

\subsection{Second Person}

\subsection{Third Person}

The existence of two types of third person pronouns is hypothesized to be because of the disappearance of the \emph{Agentive Construction} in the past tense - i.e: standard urdu \textit{ne} --> \textit{ine, une}

\textit{hameN, tumheN} --> the usage of these as nominative rather than oblique forms appears to be a Dakhini innovation

\subsubsection{Proximate}
\subsubsection{Distant}

\section{Relative and Interrogative Pronouns}

\subsection{Reflective Adjective}

\subsection{Variations}

\subsubsection{Closer To The Paradigm = Wider Variety}
\subsubsection{Substitution of Plural for Singular}
\subsubsection{Interference From Standard Urdu}

\section{Verbs}

Four types of verb constructions:

\subsection{Formed From Present Participle}

\subsubsection{Present Participle = Indefinite Tense}
\subsubsection{Present Participle + Past Auxiliary = Imperfect Tense}
\subsubsection{Adverbial: Present Participle ending in -te}

To describe the duration/context of an action.

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Non-Use of the auxiliary hai in indefinite tense statements
\item
Disappearance of the feminine plural suffix
\item
Interference from standard urdu
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formed From Past Participle}

\subsubsection{Past Participle = Past Tense}
\subsubsection{Past Participle + Bound Auxiliary = Past Tense}
\subsubsection{Past Participle + Past Auxiliary = Pluperfect Tense}
\subsubsection{Adverbial: Past Participle ending in -e}

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Non-use of the auxiliary \textit{hai} in past tense constructions
\item
Disappearance of the feminine plural
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Based on Verb Root}

\subsubsection{Root + raa = Continuous Present Tense}
\subsubsection{Root + raa + thaa = Past Continuous Tense}
\subsubsection{Adverbial Construction: Special}

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Non-use of the auxiliary \textit{hai} in the formation of the present continuous
\item
Two alternate forms of regular primary system constructions are found
\item
Interference from standard urdu
\item
Variant forms of \textit{ko}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verb Root + Inflectional Suffixes, Infinitives}

\subsubsection{Subjunctive}
\subsubsection{Verb root + zero suffix = imperative}
\subsubsection{Subjunctive + gaa/gii = Future Tense}
\subsubsection{Verb Root + naa = Infinitive}

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Substitution of the infinitive for the first person singular subjunctive
\item
Non-use of the future tense terminating in \textit{gaa}
\item
Formation of the infinitive by the suffixation of \textit{-aunaa} rather than \textit{naa}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Auxiliary Verbs}

\section{The Primary System of Dakhini Urdu}

The primary system is considered to be that version of the dialect which:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Contains a maximum number of historically derived distinctions
\item
Contains a minimum number of innovations in the use of historical forms
\item
Contains a minimum number of forms or constructions borrowed from other languages
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features of Primary Dakhini}

Based on the collected data and interviews with the speaker, we can determine that the speaker of a primary system version of Dakhini has the following features in their speech:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Future tense terminates in either \textit{-gaa}, \textit{-gii} or \textit{-ge}
\item
The subjunctive first person singular terminates in \textit{-uuN}
\item
In statements containing the indefinite tense, the present participle + auxiliary construction is used to make up the indefinite tense of the verb
\item
In the past tense, the past participle + auxiliary construction is occasionally used instead of just the past participle
\item
The auxiliary is used in the formation of the present continuous tense
\item
A complete pronoun paradigm- i.e all the pronouns in all the classes mentioned are used.
\item
The feminine third person plural ends in \textit{-ain} or \textit{-iin}.
\item
Correct gender classification of nouns into their respective masculine/feminine forms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Omissions in Primary Dakhini}

Based on the data collected, the following features are definitely not present in the speech of a speaker of the primary system version of Dakhini:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Substitution of the first person plural pronoun \textit{ham} in place of the first person singular pronoun \textit{maiN}
\item
Substitution of the masculine suffix for the feminine suffix in second person plural constructions.
\end{itemize}
