\section{Nouns}

\subsection{Three Classes of Nouns}

\subsubsection{Class 1: Marked Masculine Noun}

\begin{itemize}
\item
This type of noun terminates in the suffixes:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\emph{-aa} in the nominative singular
	\item
	\emph{-e} in the nominative plural and in the oblique singular
	\end{itemize}
\item[Eg:  ]
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[child]
	baccha (singular), bacche (plural)
	\item[cloth]
	kapRaa (singular), kapRe (plural)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unmarked Masculine/Feminine Noun}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
These nouns occur with the plural suffix \emph{-aaN}
\item[Eg:  ]
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[apple]
	seb (singular), sebaaN (plural)
	\item[book]
	kitaab (singular), kitabaaN (plural) 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unmarked Masculine/Feminine}

\begin{itemize}
\item
These nouns occur with a zero plural suffix.
\item[Eg:  ]
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[aunts]
	xaalaa (singular), xaalaa(plural)
	\item[mango]
	aam (singular), aam (plural)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postposition Class}

The postposition class is the class of, well, postpositions. This class influences nouns as all nouns occur with oblique-case suffixes before all members of this class. This is a closed class of functional morphemes, containing:

\begin{itemize}
\item
kaa/kii/ke, 'of'
\item
kuu/ko, 'to'
\item
meN, 'in'
\item
pe, 'on'
\item
tak, 'until'
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variations}

 The below are the variations shown in the noun class between the different 'systems' of Dakhini rules.
 
\subsubsection{Weakening of Gender Distinction}

Unmarked feminine nouns and loan words are often regarded as maasculine in gender, even though this may not be grammatically correct within the main system.

\subsubsection{Assimilation into Class 3}

A number of nouns that belong to classes 1 and 2 are treated by speakers as if they belong to class 3, deriving their plurals with the addition of a zero suffix.

\subsubsection{Interference from Standard Urdu}

Standard urdu contains a practice where feminine nouns are classed separately from masculine nouns using suffixes. Dakhini speakers who have studied standard Urdu in schools occasionally attempt to use these suffixes in speech.

\section{Adjectives}

\subsection{Two Classes}

\subsubsection{Marked}

\subsubsection{Unmarked}

\section{Personal Pronouns}

In free variation; however no single speaker's idiolect includes all the forms listed.

\subsection{First Person}

\subsection{Second Person}

\subsection{Third Person}

The existence of two types of third person pronouns is hypothesized to be because of the disappearance of the \emph{Agentive Construction} in the past tense - i.e: standard urdu \textit{ne} --> \textit{ine, une}

\textit{hameN, tumheN} --> the usage of these as nominative rather than oblique forms appears to be a Dakhini innovation

\subsubsection{Proximate}
\subsubsection{Distant}

\section{Relative and Interrogative Pronouns}

\subsection{Reflective Adjective}

\subsection{Variations}

\subsubsection{Closer To The Paradigm = Wider Variety}
\subsubsection{Substitution of Plural for Singular}
\subsubsection{Interference From Standard Urdu}

\section{Verbs}

Four types of verb constructions:

\subsection{Formed From Present Participle}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The present participle of a verb is formed by the suffixation of \emph{-taa/-tii/-tee} to the verb root.
\item
Participles agree in gender and number with the subject of the sentence.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Present Participle = Indefinite Tense}

The present participle occurs in sentences as the infinite tense.
\subsubsection{Present Participle + Past Auxiliary = Imperfect Tense}
\subsubsection{Adverbial: Present Participle ending in -te}

To describe the duration/context of an action.

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Non-Use of the auxiliary hai in indefinite tense statements
\item
Disappearance of the feminine plural suffix
\item
Interference from standard urdu
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formed From Past Participle}

\subsubsection{Past Participle = Past Tense}
\subsubsection{Past Participle + Bound Auxiliary = Past Tense}
\subsubsection{Past Participle + Past Auxiliary = Pluperfect Tense}
\subsubsection{Adverbial: Past Participle ending in -e}

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Non-use of the auxiliary \textit{hai} in past tense constructions
\item
Disappearance of the feminine plural
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Based on Verb Root}

\subsubsection{Root + raa = Continuous Present Tense}
\subsubsection{Root + raa + thaa = Past Continuous Tense}
\subsubsection{Adverbial Construction: Special}

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Non-use of the auxiliary \textit{hai} in the formation of the present continuous
\item
Two alternate forms of regular primary system constructions are found
\item
Interference from standard urdu
\item
Variant forms of \textit{ko}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verb Root + Inflectional Suffixes, Infinitives}

\subsubsection{Subjunctive}
\subsubsection{Verb root + zero suffix = imperative}
\subsubsection{Subjunctive + gaa/gii = Future Tense}
\subsubsection{Verb Root + naa = Infinitive}

\subsubsection{Variations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Substitution of the infinitive for the first person singular subjunctive
\item
Non-use of the future tense terminating in \textit{gaa}
\item
Formation of the infinitive by the suffixation of \textit{-aunaa} rather than \textit{naa}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Auxiliary Verbs}

\section{The Primary System of Dakhini Urdu}

The primary system is considered to be that version of the dialect which:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Contains a maximum number of historically derived distinctions
\item
Contains a minimum number of innovations in the use of historical forms
\item
Contains a minimum number of forms or constructions borrowed from other languages
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features of Primary Dakhini}

Based on the collected data and interviews with the speaker, we can determine that the speaker of a primary system version of Dakhini has the following features in their speech:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Future tense terminates in either \textit{-gaa}, \textit{-gii} or \textit{-ge}
\item
The subjunctive first person singular terminates in \textit{-uuN}
\item
In statements containing the indefinite tense, the present participle + auxiliary construction is used to make up the indefinite tense of the verb
\item
In the past tense, the past participle + auxiliary construction is occasionally used instead of just the past participle
\item
The auxiliary is used in the formation of the present continuous tense
\item
A complete pronoun paradigm- i.e all the pronouns in all the classes mentioned are used.
\item
The feminine third person plural ends in \textit{-ain} or \textit{-iin}.
\item
Correct gender classification of nouns into their respective masculine/feminine forms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Omissions in Primary Dakhini}

Based on the data collected, the following features are definitely not present in the speech of a speaker of the primary system version of Dakhini:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Substitution of the first person plural pronoun \textit{ham} in place of the first person singular pronoun \textit{maiN}
\item
Substitution of the masculine suffix for the feminine suffix in second person plural constructions.
\end{itemize}
