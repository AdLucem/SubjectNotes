#+TITLE: Representing Meaning in Different Models
#+AUTHOR: K.M


I will provide a surface-level explanation of the different modes of meaning representation frameworks here, as well as a comparision between all of them.

Ultimately we haven't found one that actually works.

Most of it is about predicate logic, yes, if you are wondering.

* Model

A meaning representation always has context within a /model/, which is:

A set of objects, properties of objects and relations between objects.
* Predicate Logic / First-Order Logic

For a basic explanation of predicate logic, go here: [[https://github.com/AdLucem/computational-semantics/blob/master/cswfp/docs/chapter-4.org][Small Predicate Logic Parser]]

So how do we map predicate logic to natural language semantics?

* Semantic Network
* Frame-Based Representation
