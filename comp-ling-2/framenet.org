* Frames

A frame is the rather obvious concept that certain words only make sense in a particular context. Hell, a particular word (form) may have different senses depending on the context.

We define each one of these 'contexts' as frames.
* FrameNet

An annotation of sentences as fitting into /frames/.
* Lesk's Algorithm
* Lesk's Algorithm using FrameNet
