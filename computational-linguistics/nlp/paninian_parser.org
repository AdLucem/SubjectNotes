* Constraints

** Ambiguous Sentence

Having several graphs that satisfy the given constraints.

** Ill-Formed/Ungrammatical Sentence

Having no parse graph that satisfies the given constraints.

* Paninian Grammar and Dependency Grammars

** Similarity

Both make use of constraint graphs.

** Differences

  - Uses an established set of kaaraka relations, instead of dependency relations
  - Constituents in Paninian parsers are restricted enough that producing their parse is reduced to a bipartite graph matching problem
