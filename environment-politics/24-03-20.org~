Why don't we have a green party in India?

* Examples Of Environmental Movements In India

Think: what would be the weakness in these issues becoming electoral agendas?

** Chipko Movement - April 1973

A contradiction between commercial interests from outside the state, and local interests (fuel, food, fodder, etc.)

"Who is going to give us fodder if we don't have trees"

Was followed by a series of lesser known movements across the country with same M.O - eg: "Apiko movement" in Karnataka

These environmental protests became protests over control of local resources

Look up: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha- when environmental issues get couched as issues about political autonomy

** Ecological Watersheds in India

- Apiko movement, 1980s
- Jharkhand Mukti Morcha - jungle kaato- finish off monocultures in the jungle
  - participants: <look @ slide> people from diveerse economic backgrounds whose livelihood depends on access to forests
- Tendu leaf policy 
  - why does the tendu leaf have political significance: is livelihood of large section of people in chhattisgarh, want good price for it 
    - tendu policy laws allows protection from extortion rackets that exist in chhattisgarh
- draft forest bill of 1982

** Draft Forest Bill scrapping, 1982

Discourse about environmentalism in India is different- pro-peasant, anti-industry, anti-local-enterprise, no local participation

Problem is top-down promotion of policy without active participation of local communities

** Mulshi Satyagraha
