#+TITLE: TagMiner : A Semisupervised Associative POS Taggers for Resource-Poor Languages
#+AUTHOR: C.A.L


Rule-based, stochastic supervised and unsupervised approaches perform poorly when there's not much data available. 
Semisupervised techniques require a large untagged corpus, too.
So how do we solve the problem for resource-poor languages, in which neither of the above are available?

* Formal Definition of the Problem

Automated POS tagging is a classification task where:

Given:

A set of tags =Tau= = {T_1, T_2... T_n}

Annotated set of tagged sentences =AS= = {S_t_1, S_t_2, ... S_t_N} 
  where S_t_i = {W_1/T_i, W_2/T_j... W_n/T_k} (Where W_i is a word and T_i is a tag from =Tau=)

And a raw untagged training corpus of sentences =D= = {S_1, S_2... S_m}, where
