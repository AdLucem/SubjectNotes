# Metaphor or Laksana

Gautama, in the Nyayasutra: transfer of meaning from objects to objects near it is pretty common.

Student: so by inference, I am your mother... ?

Gautama: here's a list of ways this transfer of meaning can happen.

Mimamsas: here's a slightly more streamlined list of five types of relationships that can exist between the primary and actual referent in cases of metaphor. One of them is Kriyayoga- "association with some action", i.e: if the actual referent does some action in a way similar enough to the actual referent to be marked out.

Student: I am not Gautama's father, then, for I perform the action in a markedly different way which his mother seems to prefer.

Later writers, including Nagesa: guys here's a similar list, because "reinventing the wheel" was a thing back then.

Student: we divide all of the factors in these lists into two factors- similarity and non-similarity. Given that a large part of Indian scholarly tradition involves rote memorization, we predict that later students will thank us.

Kumarila: similarity is /gauni vritti/ and and relations other than similarity are /lakshana/. They are both separate functions of words.

Other writers: nyeh, both of those are properties of the secondary power of words, and we shall call both /lakshana/. /Gauni lakshana/ and pure /lakshana/.

Everyone: anyway, we agree that in a meaning transfer (as in metaphor), there must be some relation between the primary and actual referent. When putting the primary meaning results in a nonsensical sentence, we resort to the secondary meaning.

Author: okay now consider a metaphor like "Devadatta is a lion"

Kumarila: look, we can see that 'lion' refers to the properties of the class "lion", and devadattah is called one because he possesses some of those properties. 

Shabara: no, you really can't say that "this thing refers to part of the whole, therefore we can call it a whole". For example, we don't say "fifty is a hundred", even though fifty is part of a hundred.

Mimamsas: also the primary meaning of the word is the universal sphota, not actions or qualities. 

Student: thus why "your mom" is not synonymous with "loose woman".

Kumarila: okay, so maybe we can say that in a qualitative metaphor, say, the whole character of the lion is superposed on devatattah because he has some qualities of the lion.

Student: guys I just want to point out that lions aren't actually brave, so "lion" is itself a metaphor, and you're just thinking about your weird fantasy version of the lion... 

Kumarila: but also we can clearly see that a man and a lion have different properties, so it's the slightly delusional speaker who can impose the properties of one onto the other.

Author: but in the case of a metaphor, assuming it's not being uttered by a speaker off his Seroquel, the speaker clearly knows that there's a difference between the primary and the actual referent. Yet he's conflating the two.

Mimamsas: look you morons, in a metaphor, **some** qualities of the primary and actual referent are shared. Not all. The actual referent can thus be derived as a sub-meaning of the primary referent, because we can relate the meaning of the actual referent to the meaning of the primary one.

For example, in "Devadatta is a lion", the word "lion" refers to "lionness", which-

Student: IN YOUR WEIRD LION FETISH FANTASY WORLD-

Mimamsas: refers to cool things like courage and bitchin' hair. The presence of a subset of these properties- namely, the courage and not the bitchin' mane- in devadattah entitles the speaker to call him a lion.

This we prove by the fact that when we see a word, we think of it's primary meaning first. Finding that unsuitable, we *derive* the secondary meaning, proving that one is derived from the other and not that the word has just sprouted a new referent.

## Buddhists: Meaning Via Metaphoric Transfer

Buddhists: but hey, words have no "actual" meaning. We cannot comprehend the actual nature of objects, so the "meaning" of a word is the mental image it calls up. Given this, how can a thing that has no reality- a word- be applied to refute said so-called reality? Remember, we think that the "meaning" of the word is simply the exclusion of all objects denoted by the word; nothing more, nothing less.

Author: words have meaning via metaphoric transfer, as they can refer to objects indirectly. Therefore meaning itself is a form of _lakshana_.

Mimamsas: Hey we sorta agree, direct meaning is a type of lakshana (metaphorical transfer from mental image to actual object), and actual metaphor is second-order lakshana.

## Types of Lakshana

- Jahallakshana: direct meaning is discarded, only the metaphorical or indirect meaning is conveyed. As in: "the house is on the ganges" meaning "the house is on the banks of the ganges (not on the river itself"

- Ajahallakshana: direct meaning is kept, indirect meaning is also conveyed. Eg: "the lances enter" means "the men (with the lances) enter"

- Jahadajahallakshana: only part of the direct meaning is kept, rest is discarded. Eg: "the cloth is burnt" means "only part of the cloth has been burned"

- Lakshitalakshana: relation between primary and secondary referents is not direct, but indirect using some other word. Eg: "dvirepha" --> word raving two r's --> bhramara --> bee. This type of lakshana is the basis of cockney rhyming slang, for example, where a word's referent is determined by words it rhymes with. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conditions for Lakshana

- Incompatibility of the primary (literal) meaning of the word with the meaning of the sentence. 

- There should be a second meaning (derived from the primary meaning) of the word which is compatible with the meaning of the sentence. _yogyata_ of the sentence is still preserved because incompatibility of the word is only with the **literal** meaning.

- The secondary sense should have the sanction of convention or everyday usage, since you cannot go randomly converting words to metaphors whenever you feel like. Note: when a word has been been used in the secondary sense for so long that the primary meaning of the word has faded and the current "primary" meaning is the metaphorical sense, it is known as **faded metaphor**

## Bhartrhari's Views on Lakshana

It is meaningless to discuss the primary and secondary referents of an individual word; the sentence has to be considered as a whole, and the meaning taken in context.
