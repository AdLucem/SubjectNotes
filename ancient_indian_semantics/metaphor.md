# Metaphor or Laksana

Gautama, in the Nyayasutra: transfer of meaning from objects to objects near it is pretty common.

Me: so by inference, I am your mother... ?

Gautama: here's a list of ways this transfer of meaning can happen.

Mimosas: here's a slightly more streamlined list of five types of relationships that can exist between the primary and actual referent in cases of metaphor. One of them is Kriyayoga- "association with some action", i.e: if the actual referent does some action in a way similar enough to the actual referent to be marked out.

Me: I am not Gautama's father, then, for I perform the action in a markedly different way which his mother seems to prefer.

Later writers, including Nagesa: guys here's a similar list, because "reinventing the wheel" was a thing back then.

Author: we divide all of the factors in these lists into two factors- similarity and non-similarity. Given that a large part of Indian scholarly tradition involves rote memorization, we predict that later students will thank us.

Kumarila: similarity is /gauni vritti/ and and relations other than similarity are /lakshana/. They are both separate functions of words.

Other writers: nyeh, both of those are properties of the secondary power of words, and we shall call both /lakshana/. /Gauni lakshana/ and pure /lakshana/.

Everyone: anyway, we agree that in a meaning transfer (as in metaphor), there must be some relation between the primary and actual referent. When putting the primary meaning results in a nonsensical sentence, we resort to the secondary meaning.

Author: okay now consider a metaphor like "Devadatta is a lion"

Kumarila: look, we can see that 'lion' refers to the properties of the class "lion", and devadattah is called one because he possesses some of those properties. 

Shabara: no, you really can't say that "this thing refers to part of the whole, therefore we can call it a whole". For example, we don't say "fifty is a hundred", even though fifty is part of a hundred.

Mimosas: also the primary meaning of the word is the universal sphota, not actions or qualities. 

Me: thus why "your mom" is not synonymous with "loose woman".

Kumarila: okay, so maybe we can say that in a qualitative metaphor, say, the whole character of the lion is superposed on devatattah because he has some qualities of the lion.

X: guys I just want to point out that lions aren't actually brave, so "lion" is itself a metaphor, and you're just thinking about your weird fantasy version of the lion... 

Kumarila: but also we can clearly see that a man and a lion have different properties, so it's the slightly delusional speaker who can impose the properties of one onto the other.

Author: but in the case of a metaphor, assuming it's not being uttered by a speaker off his Seroquel, the speaker clearly knows that there's a difference between the primary and the actual referent. Yet he's conflating the two.

Mimosas: look you morons, in a metaphor, **some** qualities of the primary and actual referent are shared. Not all. The actual referent can thus be derived as a sub-meaning of the primary referent, because we can relate the meaning of the actual referent to the meaning of the primary one.

For example, in "Devadatta is a lion", the word "lion" refers to "lionness", which-

Deadpool: IN YOUR WEIRD LION FETISH FANTASY WORLD-

Mimosa: refers to cool things like courage and bitchin' hair. The presence of a subset of these properties- namely, the courage and not the bitchin' mane- in devadattah entitles the speaker to call him a lion.

This we prove by the fact that when we see a word, we think of it's primary meaning first. Finding that unsuitable, we *derive* the secondary meaning, proving that one is derived from the other and not that the word has just sprouted a new referent.
