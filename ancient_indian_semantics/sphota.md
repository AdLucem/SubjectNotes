# Sphota

Author: _sphota_ is derived from the root of "to burst", as in, "that from which the meaning bursts forth"

Bhartrhari: I developed and formalised _sphota_. I am the best.

Author: actually you can see references to sphota-like theories even in these older texts- 

Bhartrhari: I. Am. The. Best.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Sphota According To Bhartrhari

- Speech-principle (that which is cognized):
	- speech
	- thought

- sentence: single undivided utterance

- sentence meaning: instantaneous flash of insight

- words are only theoretical abstractions from a sentence; a sentence is an indivisible linguistic whole

## History of Sphota

Patanjali: actually, my dear bitch, term-coining is first-come-first-serve. And since I, in my mahabhashya, mentioned the term _sphota_ first, I get full claim to it's _sphota_. According to my version of sphota:

- Words have two aspects: _sphota_ and _dhvani_
- _sphota_ : permanent element of the word; what the word basically "means"
- _dhvani_ : ephemeral and fleeting realization of the actual word
- _sphota_ can be a single letter or a sequence of letters.


Student: hey, this is a lot like the emic-etic distinction in classic linguistics.

Patanjali: *ignoring the student* _sphota_ is constant, unchanging, not affected by the peculiarities of it's actual speech-realization- that is, the _dhvani_ uttered by the actual speaker.

Vyadi, a Grammarian: hey, this _sphota-dhvani_ thing is a lot like the _prakrita-dhvani_ - _vaikrita-dhvani_ distinction that we later grammarians spoke about!

Patanjai: oh okay, I'll cite you in my book.

Student: just like I "cite" authors in my assignment papers?

Katyayana: *strolls in, ignores everyone* so, kids, expounding on what patanjali copied- ahem, I mean, *cited*, from us, it's essential to make a distinction between the mental permanent elements of language and their temporary realizations via sound. _Vritti_ (speech/style of diction) is temporary, _varnas_ (letters) are forever. 

Patanjali: *ignoring katyayana's shade thrown* so as I said, _sphota_ is the time-series pattern of letters, and _dhvani_ is the actual sound! 

Katyayana: *cough* changing variable names *cough*

Later Grammarians: but wait, Patanjali! According to you _sphota_ has a **size** - it's a fixed sequence of letters- but according to us, _sphota_ has no size, parts or "measurable" elements!

Author: yes, look, Patanjali's conception of _sphota_ was very different from your conception of _sphota_ as a single meaning-carrying linguistic symbol.

Some Later Commentator: but but we can clearly see that Patanjai fully developed the _sphota_ theory-

Author: shut up.

## Mimansas: Men of (Permanent) Letters  

Mimamsas: letters- which, in our enlightened language are sound-units- are permanent and virtual. Sounds are temporary and real.

Author: that sounds a lot like the concept of phonemes.

Mimansakas: so, the word- the **actual** word, not the thing you creatures utter- is the aggregate of its letters/sound units.

Patanjali: OBJECTION! A word is that which when uttered brings about the notion of "the thing meant by the word". For example, what is meant by the word "cow"? It is that which, when uttered- uttered not as in "spoken", of course, but as in revealed-

Student: cows and revealing. I am suppressing the obvious joke here.

Patanjali: -when uttered, brings about the understanding of that thing in the field, with a tail, lumps, horns, hooves, and the student's father as husband.

Student: HEY!

Patanjali: and corollary- before the mimamsikas try to make up any nonsensical insults against *my* mother- a word is only a word when it means something.

Mimamsakas: no.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Brief Digression: Problem With Giving Meaning To A Temporal Series

Katyayana: sounds are destroyed as soon as they are produced. So how can they come together and form a sequence?

Patanjali: well, you have a mind, presumably? The letters come together and exist as a sequence there. No, don't ask me how exactly this happens.

Student: so hey, do individual letters have a meaning, or do they only have meaning when they come together in a sequence?

Patanjali: individual letters sometimes have meaning, as in the case of inflectional morphemes that consist of a single letter. And sometimes they don't, as in the case of letters within a morpheme. Take that as you will.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Nyayikas: Letters are NOT forever

Nyaya Philosphers: what are these guys smoking? A word is only a collection of sounds produced by a speaker; it's ephemeral, it has no permanent meaning.

Author: how do you explain how different people understand the letters that are uttered with different tone, speech, clarities etc. as the same concept?

Nyayas: because each utterance that is mapped to the same concept, is but one instance of the same Universal; the utterances are only recognized as same because they're similar (because of this mapping)

Student: bro, what are *you* smoking?

Nyayikas: And the meaning is presented to the mind of the speaker only by the last sound, helped by the recollections of the preceding sounds.

Patanjali: isn't that what I-

Nyayikas: since the sounds come one after the other, they are not perceived as a whole, but it is the apprehension of the last sound + memory recall of the preceeding sound, that makes meaning burst forth in the mind of the speaker.

Patanjali: nevermind.

Author: that makes no sense. If the sounds come into the mind one after the other, how can they simultaneously attach themselves to the meaning? There *must* be a single unit in the mind that corresponds to the meaning understood by the hearer; such an unit is _sphota_.

Mimamsakas: actually I agree with the Nyayikas, because if a word is only the aggregate of its sounds then there can be no independent meaning-carrying entity called "word". But letters are permanent, so their combination in the hearer's mind can carry meaning.

Yogasutra: see, all a' you ignore one distinction. The spoken word, the "thing-meant" and the concept formed in the mind- *all three of those* are different things. Ordinary people confuse the three because of their (incorrect) superposition, but I'd expect y'all to know better.

Vyasa: but but- I disagree about the nature of _Sphota_ on some fine, pedantic academic level, and I don't care what you say! Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh!

Grammarians: hear hear!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dhvani-Sphota Split

One Guy: the _sphota_ is the "original" sound produced by the vocal chords, the _dhvani_ is the sound that propagates from that in all directions.

Another Guy: close but not quite. The _dhvani_ and the _sphota_ are produced together. The _sphota_ is like the flame; the _dhvani_ is the light that spreads from the flame.

Totally Not Bhartrhari: no, see, we need to follow proper OOP principles. The _sphota_ is the class; the _dhvanis_ are the various members of that class by whose existence we infer the existence of the class itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bhartrhari's Analysis of The Nature of Language

There are three parts to language:

- _Vaikrita dhvani_ : individual instance of the utterance in purely phonetic terms
- _Prakrita Dhvani_ : phonological/sound structure of the utterance, stripped of all individual characteristics
- _Sphota_ : the integral linguistic symbol, the unit of meaning that cannot be pronounced or written

Later European linguists agreed with this too, terming the latter two distictions the **signifier-signified** distinction- as in, the word (the thing doing the signifying) and the meaning (the thing signified).

## Divisible vs Indivisible: Whole or Partial Sphota?

Is the sphota comprehended as a whole, or can it be divided?

Or the third view: is it a symbolic idea?
