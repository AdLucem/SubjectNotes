# Suggestion

Mimamsas and Nyayas: meaning can be both literal and metaphorical. Here's a theory about it.

Anandavardhana: meaning can be emotive and associative too!

Bhartrhari: after all, since I so eloquently theorized that, according to my version of _sphota_, listeners understand the sentence as a single meaning, it would be stupid to say that words only correspond to their individual lexical meanings and nothing else.

Also, the meaning of a sentence often depends on context.

Also, we can't just put together the individual meaning of all the words in a sentence and say "Here, this is what this sentence means!". Well, we can sometimes, but there are many cases where we cannot.

Ananda: I didn't hear what he said but yes! Like my sempai Bhartrhari, I also support the undivided _sphota_ theory. I'm too into the literary appreciation of these... literatures, though, so I won't talk about this further.

Vedic Sages: obviously. The literal meaning of an utterance is only a small part of its actual meanings. Woe be the man who is too uncouth to look at the inner significance of a line, seeing only the surface meaning thereof!

Student: that is totally not 3000-year old salt thrown at the statistical linguists.

Vedas: "It is only to the latter that Speech reveals herself completely, like a loving wife to her husband."

Vedic Sage (presumably): like your wife did to me last night, eh?

Ananda: anyway guys, along with literal and metaphorical meanings of utterances, utterances can have a third type of meaning: suggestive meaning! I'mma call this _Vyanjana_

Mimansikas and Nyayakas: Listen, all that fluffery is well and good, but we're concerned with the accuracy and precision of words, and analysing them objectively. Suggestions are subjective.

Poets: fuck you guys, the "language behavior" you claim to analyze so objectively is but a tiny drop of water in the fullness of the ocean of language. You concern yourself with facts, and logic, and logic-transferrable facts, and mock the intricacies of contextual meaning therein; but such intricacies are simply beyond your vaunted ability to analyze.

Ananda and other literary critics: see, literal meaning is fine and all, but above all of those, there is the meaning that speech communities ascribe to certain words or utterances, and that is above and all the most important meaning of language!

Author: also, not even the most hard-core literal-meaning objectivists (*cough* Mimamsikas and Nyayakas *cough*) can deny that the power of words to bring about emotions does not come thanks to the words' literal meaning.

Ananda: yes! And so, I won't just look at the surface form of the utterance, but I'll study the context, the intonation, stress, gestures and even the pure phonemes of the utterance!

Bhartrhari: so, as I say, not only the sound-patterns which reveal the linguistic sign (_sphota_), but also the individual characteristics of a speaker's utterance, have an important role in speech understanding. Thus we must include in our study, not only the normal speech-patterns of language, but also those deviant characteristics that indicate whether the speaker is drunk, whispering, or your mom.

Ananda: but sempaiiii.... I don't care about all of those! I'm only interested in those elements of language that fit my #aesthetic! I even have a name for my special thing, see- _dhvani_, which is suggestion as applied to poetry!

## Dhvani Theory

Student: you just ripped off _dhvani_ from the grammarians.

Ananda: no, no, I *adapted* it, see? Just like the grammarian's notion of _dhvani_ is the utterance series that reveals the internal linguistic sign, so my new and updated notion of _dhvani_ are the elements in a good poem that reveal its prettay #aesthetic signs!

Student: I... some misuse of the term "sign" but okay.

Ananda: *ignoring the student* See, suggestion is the soul of poetry. Beatiful ideas in poetry are of two types: the literal, which is like the charm of a woman's face, and the implied, which is like the charm of a beautiful woman independent of the beauty of the combined features of the body.

Student: It has never been more evident that the ancient Indian linguists were men, and that so is the author of this damn book.

Ananda: *dreaming* mmmm... combined features of dat ass... *jerks back to the present* Oh yeah anyway, the expressed sense in poems is a figure of speech only, but the implied sense can be: 
    - an idea
    - a figure of speech
    - an emotion

Only men of taste like me and sempai can understand the implied meaning. 

Suggestion is the highest element in poetry. It is the degree of power of the suggestive sense over the literal sense that makes poetry beautiful. Sometimes the literal sense predominates over the suggested sense- this type of poetry might have some charm, but ehhh who am I kidding. Poetry is only good if it has at least some degree of predominance of the suggested sense. See I'm cool because I'm the first one who actually systematically goes on and on about the emotive/suggestive sense of poetry!

## Criticisms of Dhvani Theory

### Dhvani is Basically Inference 

Mahimabhatta: what you call _dhvani_ is basically inference with a fancy name. The implied sense in literature is always conveyed by the expressed sense via inference.

Ananda: inb4 you include _dhvani_ in inference- inference depends on a relation between the primary and suggested sense of the utterance, while _dhvani_ often does not. For example: a ray of light may illuminate a pot even though the ray has no relation at all to the pot.

### Dhvani is Not Worth Considering

Jayantabhatta, from the POV of a logician: _dhvani_, lol. Don't be a smartass, you can't infer something this ephemeral and wishy-washy. We will stick to the precise, exact sense of words that can be manipulated by logic, and what we cannot precisely define, we will ignore.

Author: All right then, I suppose you're fine with a linguistic theory that ignores more than half of actual language work.

### Dhvani is a special type of Inference: Arthapatti

Logicians et al: _dhvani_ is a special type of metaphorical inference, where the information is inferred by what is not said but could have been, rather than what is said.

Jespersan: yea, as I call it, _dhvani_ is "impression by suppression"

Author: _arthapatti_ is a means of valid knowledge and thus implies accuracy and unambiguity, whereas _dhvani_ is not accurate and its presence is based on the literary taste of the speaker.

### Dhvani is Metaphor (Lakshana)

Mukulabhatta: _dhvani_ is included under _lakshana_, because it is basically a form of metaphor where the literal sense leads to some other idea rather than some idea related to the literal sense.

Ananda: _lakshana_ comes only when the primary sense is nonsensical and is rejected by the user, but in _dhvani_ the primary sense can also make sense.

Author: But there's also a type of _lakshana_ where the primary sense also makes sense. No, a better argument is that _lakshana_ comes only when there is a primary sense, whereas in case of _dhvani_, there need not be a primary sense at all- like, say, suggestion invoked by music or gestures.

### Dhvani Is Included In The Primary Meaning

Mimamsikas of the Prabhakara school: the _abhida_ or conventional sense is as wide as we say it is, and anything- including suggestion- that is conveyed by the word is included in its primary meaning. No need for special words.

Ananda: the power of _abhida_ is exhausted when the primary meaning is conveyed. Also primary meaning is conventional sense, whereasmen of taste like me are NOT conventional and boring!
