Affect is multidimensional. It is more complex than the simple positive/negative often used in machine learning. Since emotions fall upon a wide spectrum and are multivariate, there is no one agreed-upon theory of affect.

Their typical applications are [...]. [references where the specific model is used]

One of the different affect models used in research is:
> A Concentric Circles Perspective of Consumer Behavior Theory
> ekman's 6 emotions (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise)
> valence-arousal-dominance theory
> plutchik's wheel- a darwinian approach to affect

Affective representations or context aware effect/emotions are important because [...]

Without an affective representation, we can't identify creative uses of language like sarcasm, irony, humor and metaphorical language.

Some texts, such as social media text, can include nonstandard language to express some affect. The meaning of these texts cannot be deduced by standard semantic parsers, unless we include a level of affect parsing. For example, "He's fiiiiiineeeeee" has a different denotation ('he is attractive') than "He's fine" ('his condition is fine').

Emotional context is needed for correct interpretation in several situations. For example, sometimes we cannot tell whose perspective a text is from, but infer perspective based on emotion conveyed in the text. Affect modelling is thus a necessary aspect of discourse level parsing [...]

One of the key confusions about affect is evoked vs. perceived vs. expressed affect ...

No, I would not use affect related techniques in my course project because machine translation focuses primarily on getting the semantics correct, and affect is in the realm of pragmatics.

However, this is a narrow view of translation, necessitated by the fact that the current machine translation quality estimation data focuses on sentence-level quality estimation, whereas affect can be spread across multiple sentences or an entire paragraph. Besides, the lack of data on affect-matching machine translation makes

In human 

However, affect related techniques would be useful in the following projects: [...]
